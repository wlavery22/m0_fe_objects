# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Small syntax errors due to absent-mindedness. I was not being careful enough and paying close enough attention.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note-taking is going ok, particurlarly while reading, sometimes I forget to take notes when someone provides a solution for a 
problem I didn't attempt. I need to work on this so I can study how they solved something I didn't or couldn't.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I usually try on my own 1st, consulting my notes if I need to. If that doesn't work I go to google and mdn docs (mozilla).
